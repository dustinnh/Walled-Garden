# Dashboard Assets

This directory contains shared dashboard assets for the Walled Garden system.

## Directory Structure

```
dashboard/
├── css/                      # Shared CSS files
│   └── authelia-custom.css  # Authelia theme customization
└── README.md                 # This file
```

## Purpose

This directory stores shared assets that are used by the dashboard but aren't specific to any single plugin:

- **CSS files**: Custom styling for Authelia and the dashboard
- **Shared JavaScript**: Common functionality (if needed)
- **Images/Icons**: Shared visual assets (if needed)

## How It Works

1. **Build Process**: When you run `./scripts/build.py`, these files are copied to `output/dashboard/`
2. **Plugin UI Files**: Individual plugin UI files (like dns.html, admin.html) are stored in their respective plugin directories and also copied during build
3. **Deployment**: The dashboard directory is mounted into the Caddy container to serve these files

## CSS Files

### authelia-custom.css

This file customizes the Authelia login page to match the Walled Garden's purple gradient theme:

- Purple gradient background matching the dashboard
- Hidden Authelia branding for a cleaner look
- Responsive design improvements
- Consistent visual language across all interfaces

To use this CSS with Authelia, it should be configured in your Authelia configuration:

```yaml
theme: auto
# Custom CSS is injected via Caddy or volume mount
```

## Integration with Plugin System

The dashboard works with the plugin system as follows:

1. **Static Assets**: Shared files (CSS, images) live here
2. **Plugin UI**: Each plugin can provide its own UI files in `plugins/[plugin]/ui/`
3. **Generated Dashboard**: The main `index.html` is generated by `build-dashboard.py` from enabled plugins
4. **Build Output**: Everything is combined in `output/dashboard/` during build

## Customization

To customize the dashboard theme:

1. Edit `css/authelia-custom.css` for login page styling
2. Modify plugin manifests to change dashboard card appearance
3. Use `plugins-config.json` to set dashboard title and subtitle

## Example Docker Volume Mount

```yaml
services:
  caddy:
    volumes:
      - ./output/dashboard:/srv/dashboard
```
